                " The college provided us with one of the best facilities in education as well as our overall
                development. Nurturing the student from all aspect of life is the quality of faculty. Industrial
                interaction, skill development, practical exposure are part of regular curriculum. The college provides
                you with good placement opportunities as well as builds you to face the real world.

                "This is one of the finest educational institution wherein I was privileged to be an engineer from. The
                faculty is very encouraging and supportive by providing multiple ways (technical/non-technical) to
                students to enhance their skill-set. Today I am among global leaders for various Cyber Security

                During my college days, I really liked the fact the professors here were very supportive and
                approachable. They gave me the solid understanding of Computer Engineering subjects throughout 4 years.
                Due to the foundation laid in this college, I could pursue higher education like MBA for University of
                Wales, UK and currently doing PhD research as well.The professors really pushed us during final</p>
